# Transaction visualizer

This is a demo D3 visualization to visualize account statements in form of a `.csv` file with the german header

>Buchung;Valuta;Sender / Empfänger;IBAN / Konto-Nr.;BIC / BLZ;Buchungstext;Verwendungszweck;Kategorie;Stichwörter;Umsatz geteilt;Betrag in EUR

The `.csv`file has to be named `transactions.csv` and placed in the directory. It will not be included in the git repository.
